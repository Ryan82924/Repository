# To-Facts
<!--[My Notes](notes.md)

For the AWS Section. I learned a lot about how to set up a web server on the Amazon cloud. I learned that there are a lot of different types of domains. There are also a lot of rules you can use in the records sections which helps control the routing. This is somewhat similar to the redirects in WordPress. However it is a little bit different in that these rules can form the basis of the site and the site cannot always function without them. 

For the HTML section I learned a lot about using html to group components together, specifically making list like structuers. I learned that sometimes instead of using unordered lists or other actual list components its better to make div groups that are grouped together because it allows more functionality. I also learned a bit about HTML semantics. Such as sectioning div groups and other items and using nav around links.

For the CSS section I learned a lot about using styling to make HTML components pretty. I learned that there are certain subtle differences that can give you the results you need. Like setting height to 100vh expands the height to fill screen while setting it to 100% doesn't. (Which I guess makes sense since vh = view height) I also learned a lot about CSS components and using them to get results on the HTMl components that look good. 

For the React Part 1 I learned about using nav links to set up routing as a single page application. I also learned about establishing each HTML component as a React component I also learned a lot about modularization as well.

For React Part 2 I learned a lot about the syntax requirements (syntax errors/debugging took the most amount of time). I also learned a lot about the different components of a functional react app like use effect and use state.
in addition I felt like I learned a lot about JS functions and react specific functions as well. I felt like so far this part of the project has helped me to learn the most out of all of the parts. 

For Simon Service I felt like I learned a lot about working between the front and the backend. Once again the syntax errors and the debugging took a lot of time for me. I also felt like I learned a lot more about async code and await. Which was something that I was a little confused about before but I felt like I got a better hold of during this process. I also felt like I learned a bit about debugging code and writing better JS/react since this section was almost entirely made of JS.  

For the Database I felt like I learned a lot from it, particularly about how to establish the database connection with the service and how websites interact with a database to store information. I also felt like I learned a lot about how the importance of directly affecting objects vs making copies. I often unintentionally made copies and the database would not receive the updates if I updated the copies. 

For the Websocket I learned a lot about how the websocket instances work and how to implement them in the website. I learned a lot about using the development environment to examine data actively in the website. (I needed to do this to see if the WS was working.) I also learned a lot about debugging and stepping through code as I needed to debug the WS quite a bit to get it to work. This was defintely the most complex deliverable for me as there were a lot of steps, especially in getting the WS set up and getting it to connect.

To-Facts is an application that gives unique, interesting facts pulled from the internet after the completion of a task. To-Facts helps users to be able to keep track of items on their to-do list while also helping motivate them to complete these items through a reward system that gives an interesting fact upon the completion of a task.  

## ðŸš€ Specification Deliverable

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- `[x]` Proper use of Markdown
- `[x]` A concise and compelling elevator pitch
- `[x]` Description of key features
- `[x]` Description of how you will use each technology
- `[x]` One or more rough sketches of your application. Images must be embedded in this file using Markdown image references.

### Elevator pitch

Have you ever stared at a to-do list for minutes, even hours dreading the idea of having to do the tasks on the list. To-Facts makes doing items on a to-do list fun! It gives an interesting fact to a person after checking off a task. They can be funny, interesting, useful, or quirky facts. Doing items on your to-do list has never been so gratifying. To_Facts help you to stay on task and get things done, giving entertainment along the way with surprise facts!

### Key features

- Features a list of to-do items associated with a user (Remains persistent and is updated)
- Features secure login over HTTPS
- Is responsive to the environment (Size changes with screen size)
- User has the ability to drag and drop tasks
- Implements a reward system that displays random facts pulled from the web upon task completion
- Ability to add and remove tasks, as well as to mark complete or incomplete
- A live global leaderboard that displays number of tasks completed from all users
 

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - Proper HTML semantics used. There will be a login page for user authentication, a to-do list page for task management and a leaderboard page that displays live task completion data. 
- **CSS** - CSS takes on a responsive, user-friendly and professional appearance. Tasks in the list looks good as well as the buttons and the facts. Tasks styled as interactive blocks and will visually change states when completed.  Leaderboard positions will appear in neatly styled blocks as well.
- **React** - Allows the app to be dynamic, allowing the user to interact with the app in real time and perform activities such as check and uncheck tasks. Ensures fetched data like facts/login are pulled from the backend to be used in the user interface. 
- **Service** - Backend service will manage API interactions including both third party API's and my own custom work. It will:  
  1. Grab fun facts from the external API.
  2. Process and return the data to the frontend.
  3. Have custom functions that manage to-do list operations such as adding and deleting tasks.
- **DB/Login** - Stores login data and updated to-do list data associated with the login. Secure and cannot be accessed unless logged in. Tasks are private and will not be visible to other users. 
- **WebSocket** - Collects real-time data from all users and compiles them into a leaderboard which updates in real time as users complete tasks.
