# To-Facts

[My Notes](notes.md)

To-Facts is an application that gives unique facts pulled from the internet after the completion of a to-do list item. 


> [!NOTE]
>  This is a template for your startup application. You must modify this `README.md` file for each phase of your development. You only need to fill in the section for each deliverable when that deliverable is submitted in Canvas. Without completing the section for a deliverable, the TA will not know what to look for when grading your submission. Feel free to add additional information to each deliverable description, but make sure you at least have the list of rubric items and a description of what you did for each item.

> [!NOTE]
>  If you are not familiar with Markdown then you should review the [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) before continuing.

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [ ] Proper use of Markdown
- [ ] A concise and compelling elevator pitch
- [ ] Description of key features

### Elevator pitch

Have you ever stared at a to-do list for minutes, even hours dreading the idea of having to do the tasks on the list. To-Facts makes doing items on a to-do list fun! It gives an interesting fact to a person after completing a task. They can be funny, interesting, useful, useless or just plain wacky facts. Doing items on your to-do list has never been so gratifying.

### Key features

- The application will feature a list of to-do items associated with a user. (Remains persistent and is updated.)

- The application will be responsive to the environment.
- The application will have the ability to drag and drop tasks
- The application will feature random facts from the web.
- 

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - Proper HTML will be used. There will be a login page and a to-do list page. 
- **CSS** - CSS will be responsive, the color choice will be easy on the eyes and look professional. It also will have proper spacing. Provides the design for the tasks in the list and for the buttons as well as the facts. 
- **React** - Allows the app to be dynamic, allowing the user to check and uncheck tasks, also allows for the fact to be fetched and displayed.
- **Service** - Backend service that has a call to both an external API (the fun fact servers) and my own functions that accepts the data from the API and uses it appropriately. 
- **DB/Login** - Stores login data and updated to-do list data associated with the login. Secure and cannot be accessed unless logged in. 
- **WebSocket** - Pushes updates to the frontend in real time. Includes updates from my own functions of facts that were grabbed from the external API.
