# To-Facts
<!--[My Notes](notes.md)-->


To-Facts is an application that gives unique, interesting facts pulled from the internet after the completion of a task. To-Facts helps users to be able to keep track of items on their to-do list while also helping motivate them to complete these items through a reward system that gives an interesting fact upon the completion of a task.

- Ability to add and remove tasks, as well as to mark complete or incomplete

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - Proper HTML semantics used. There will be a login page for user authentication and a to-do list page for task management. 
- **CSS** - CSS takes on a responsive, user-friendly and professional appearance. Tasks in the list looks good as well as the buttons and the facts. Tasks styled as interactive blocks and will visually change states when completed.  
- **React** - Allows the app to be dynamic, allowing the user to interact with the app in real time and perform activities such as check and uncheck tasks. Ensures fetched data like facts/login are pulled from the backend to be used in the user interface. 
- **Service** - Backend service will manage API interactions including both third party API's and my own custom work. It will:  
  1. Grab fun facts from the external API.
  2. Process and return the data to the frontend.
  3. Have custom functions that manage to-do list operations such as adding and deleting tasks.
- **DB/Login** - Stores login data and updated to-do list data associated with the login. Secure and cannot be accessed unless logged in. Tasks are private and will not be visible to other users. <!--Also stores task completed data, also pushes the highest task completed ones to a leaderboard html page? -->
- **WebSocket** - Pushes updates to the frontend in real time. Includes syncing to-do list changes across different devices if the same user is logged in. <!--Also includes pushing fact updates to the frontend after task completion. --> Also allows user to compare amount of tasks completed with leaderboard data. <!--Ask if this is needed first. -->
